dual-axis-post-processor
========================

Post Processing Script to crunch through data collected from a dual-axis scanning station.


The beginning of the script is setup to take either command line arguments defining the parameters, or you can change the parameters used in the script near the beginning by changing the variables from True to False (and vice versa) as well as changing some of the other parameters yielding the desired results.  For testing purposes, the default values should function well enough.

Any input is appreciated, especially input helping me make this code more pythonic.
